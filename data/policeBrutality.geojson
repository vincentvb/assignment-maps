Police then ordered protesters to the sidewalk. It is difficult to ascertain how the scuffle began; both protesters and police place the blame on the other. It appears that one officer and one protester got into a verbal altercation, after which the two go to the ground, grappling. The officer ends up holding the protester down, but it is difficult to determine how the incident began. This protester was apparently the father of Zane James. After this, protesters and police both became agitated and the scuffle escalated.\n\nPolice made 9 arrests, including the father of Zane James. Police beat multiple protesters with batons and pepper sprayed others. A Cottonwood Heights city councilwoman stated she was struck by police. Police state that one officer was choked to the point of unconsciousness and another was hospitalized.

Footage is dark and a little unclear, but it appears that around 2 minutes, the filmer and her sisters are pepper-sprayed. They scream in pain and the filmer states repeatedly that she cannot see. The filmer then loses track of her sisters. She finds one family member around 4 minutes, who shows clear signs of having been pepper sprayed.\n\nThe filmer and her sister attempted to regroup and find their third family member, but police continued to shove them along.\n\nAround 4:15 a protester is shoved to the ground. She can be heard screaming, \"My leg, my leg.\"\n\nAfter this, footage cuts to a shot of the filmer turns the camera on herself and her eyes are watering, showing clear indication of pepper spray. It is unclear if this is from the first round of pepper spray or she has been sprayed a second time. Medics attempt to assist her but are forced to continue marching while doing so. Around 7 minutes, medics help her into a car. She is treated for the duration of the footage.\n\nAdditional links from a reporter discuss the tactics used by police to intimidate and harass protesters. They also capture the aftermath of the pepper-spraying.", "geolocation": "41.5943362, -93.608093", "name": "Police push, shove and pepper-spray protesters", "date": "2020-06-22", "date_text": "2020-06-22", "id": "ia-desmoines-9", "lat": "41.5943362", "lon": "-93.608093", "url": "https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/tv\/CBw5mKxjHPq\/" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -93.608093, 41.5943362 ] } },

Police refused to allow protesters to leave without a bag search. Officers took protesters' bags and dumped them onto the sidewalk.\n\nThe 4th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution gives individuals the right to privacy and freedom from unreasonable searches. Most warrantless searches are considered unreasonable, with the exception of searches with consent of the searched or with probable cause. By disallowing protesters to leave, police did not allow protesters to consent. Further, probable cause has been determined on several occassions to be individualized, meaning that individuals on the premises of a crime scene cannot be searched simply for being present; rather, probable cause must be established for each individual, as in [Ybarra v. Illinois](https:\/\/www.oyez.org\/cases\/1979\/78-5937) and [United States v. Di Re](https:\/\/supreme.justia.com\/cases\/federal\/us\/332\/581\/). This means that, in order to search protester's belongings, police would have needed to establish probable cause for each protester searched.\n\nThe Terry standard does allow police to briefly detain and search an individual on reasonable suspicion, which has a lower bar than probable cause. In [Terry v. Ohio](https:\/\/supreme.justia.com\/cases\/federal\/us\/392\/1\/), the U.S. Supreme Court stated that police may stop and frisk - which is limited to an external pat down (e.g. for an readily-usable weapon), but does not include bag searches - an individual on the basis of reasonable suspicion. Reasonable suspicion is defined in the case as the reasonable suspicion that an individual may have committed, be committing, or is about to commit a crime. There must additionally be the reasonable belief that the individual is armed and dangerous. In addition, this reasonable suspicion is individualized, so police must have established reasonable suspicion that each protester searched was both armed and engaged in, had engaged in, or was going to engage in criminal conduct.\n\nAfter reviewing the rights of protesters, it appears that police conducted these searches illegally, abusing their power to prevent protesters from leaving.", "geolocation": "41.8800529, -87.6322486", "name": "Police surround protesters and search their bags", "date": "2020-08-15", "date_text": "2020-08-15", "id": "il-chicago-30", "lat": "41.8800529", "lon": "-87.6322486", "url": "https:\/\/twitter.com\/DominicGwinn\/status\/1294792483772268550" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -87.6322486, 41.8800529 ] } },

In one particular video, a counter-protester strikes a BLM protester on the back of the head and walk away. There are police officers directly in front of and behind the incident. The man tells the officer he just got punched. The officer's response is difficult to hear above the crowd, but he appears to offer little help, instead telling the protester he is not allowed to demonstrate there (on a public sidewalk).\n\nNews report includes footage of counter-protesters using racial slurs, harassing protesters and rip signs out of protester hands while police look on.", "geolocation": "38.9633126, -84.0775977", "name": "Man struck by counter-protester while police look on", "date": "2020-06-14", "date_text": "2020-06-14", "id": "oh-bethel-1", "lat": "38.9633126", "lon": "-84.0775977", "url": "https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6GVbOjgBUCc" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -84.0775977, 38.9633126 ] } },

He alleges that a police officer told him he could finish his work. The Instagram video begins at some later point as several cops approach. They tell Walker (and at least two other persons present) to \"get inside.\" For around 12 seconds, two police officers, Walker, and one other tattoo shop employee are talking simultaneously; Walker told local news he tried to go inside but one officer blocked his path. One officer can be heard to say \"I'm giving you a chance, go in,\" then another can be heard to say \"That's exactly what's going to happen -- no -- no no -- inside, go inside, inside -- go inside, there's no debate -- no, you may not.\" Said officer then begins arresting Walker. Officers shove Walker against a wall and grab his arms; they yell for him to put his hands behind his back. One officer draws a taser and holds it near Walker's shoulder. Meanwhile, one of Walker's colleagues is filming; police scream at her to \"get the fuck back -- get back.\" It's unclear whether she's standing in a doorway or backed up against a wall. Another officer is acting very aggressively and has his taser drawn until the cop next to him taps him on the arm, at which point he holsters his taser and steps back. In total, at least eight police officers are present, of whom at least two draw their tasers, despite facing little to no resistance.\n\nNOTE: While curfews in many cities exempted anyone going to or from work, Cincinnati's exempted only essential workers.
